# Pac-Man
[Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) Game with Racket Image [Library](https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdp2htdp.html)

This project was created following the instructions of the assignments for Northeastern's CS2500 Accelerated course. The assignments were given in three parts, with steadily increasing requirements. Pac-Man original [board](https://github.com/h0rban/pacman/blob/master/boardv2.rkt) was provided by the instructors. By instructor policy, the assignments and source code can only be made public by request.
